            <h4>About Ripple...</h4>
            <p>     Ripple is a technology that acts as both a cryptocurrency and a digital payment network for financial 
                transactions. It was first released in 2012 and was co-founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. 
                Ripple's main process is a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the 
                SWIFT system for international money and security transfers, which is used by banks and financial 
                middlemen dealing across currencies. The token used for the cryptocurrency is premined and utilizes 
                the ticker symbol XRP. Ripple is the name of the company and the network, and XRP is the cryptocurrency 
                token. The purpose of XRP is to serve as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between two currencies 
                or networksâ€”as a sort of temporary settlement layer denomination.
